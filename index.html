<p>I got to know Mitski by an accident, really. One day I was listening to my spotify playlist, and since I am broke, random music started popping out. That's when I heard "Me and My Husband"</p>
<p>I didn't know that, this song would change my whole life, and music taste. Mitski really helped me through difficult times, and were here, when everyone left me.</p>
<p>I am making this page as tribute. I know she won't probably ever see this, but i just felt like i need to.</p> </div>
